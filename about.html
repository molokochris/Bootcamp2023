                        My name is Moloko Chris Poopedi and I am a driven and passionate individual with a love for technology and entrepreneurship. Born and raised in Moletjie Moshate, Polokwane, Limpopo, I received my primary education at Molalahare Primary School and continued my studies at Mmakgabo Senior High School. I then went on to pursue a BCom in Human Resource Management at the University of Limpopo, where I gained a strong foundation in business and management.
                        <br><br>
                        However, my passion for technology led me to take my education further, and I completed a 4th industrial revolution programme at Regen Institute, specializing in Robotics and Cybersecurity. This experience solidified my interest in technology and solidified my desire to become a software developer. To further hone my coding skills, I attended the WETHINKCODE_ Coding Bootcamp, but unfortunately was not accepted into the 2-year programme.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite this setback, I have continued to develop my skills in Python, C Programming, Javascript, and HTML/CSS through personal projects and online resources. I am highly motivated to pursue a career as a software developer and believe that my background in business and technology will be an asset in the tech industry.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition to my love for coding, I have a strong passion for entrepreneurship and aim to combine my knowledge in business and technology to start my own tech startup. I am excited to see where my journey in the tech industry will take me and am eager to be a part of innovative and impactful projects that drive positive change. I am confident that my drive, passion, and diverse skill set make me a valuable asset to any team and I am eager to continue growing and learning in the field of technology."
